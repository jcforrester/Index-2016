So you've found my page. Which means one of two things. Either A. You're one of my professors and wanted to see my landing page, or you're a student who knows how to root through the server and find index pages. Either way, I'm glad you are here. My name is Josh Forrester, and I'm a Web Technology student here at PSTCC. I currently live at home with my parents and my dog, and I work as a host at Chili's Bar and Grill in Alcoa. I am enagaged to marry my best friend on June 10th, 2017. I will gradutate the May before that with my degree in Web Technology. My hobbies include coding, video games, board games, and snowboarding when the weather permits. Currently I am fluent in HTML and CSS, with a working knowledge of JavaScipt, and I'm working to learn responsive code (such as Bootstrap, which is powering the page). You can find the classwork above, and contact info below. Enjoy and feel free to contact me with questions, comments, concerns and cat taxes. </p>
