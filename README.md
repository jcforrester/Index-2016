# Index-2016
The site I made as as my main index page for Web Classes in 2016. I used the same site for all my classes as a homepage, and this was the collaboriation of those. Built with Bootstrap, it features a VERY similar design to the Landing page, as I still didn't use much boostrap when I created it. The site is filled with dead links that worked at one point, but are not not live since they cleared the server.
